# The Nasa Spirit
This project is a website that allows the end user to obtain the current weather for a location while also retrieving data related to the moon phase and how clear the sky is at that given moment. 

Two APIs are utilized for this application: NASA's Picture of the Day API and Visual Crossing's Weather API.
