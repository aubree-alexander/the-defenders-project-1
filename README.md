# The Nasa Spirit README
This project is a website that allows the end user to obtain the current weather for a location while also retrieving data related to the moon phase and how clear the sky is at that given moment. 

Two APIs are utilized for this application: NASA's Picture of the Day API and Visual Crossing's Weather API. By using them in tandem the end user is able to quickly ascertain stargazing conditions as well as the weather conditions.

Tailwinds was also utilized in the CSS stylings.
